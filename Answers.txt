1. PUT is one of the CRUD operations used to update data 
    while 
POST is a CRUD operation used to add given data.

2.Why validating user inputs before saving data to the database is important,
    It is a form of security to prevent attacks
    It also ensures that the specified data meets the right constraints 
    It currents application stability since corrupted and irrelevant data is not sent to the database

3.HTTP STatus Codes
    200: This indicates that a particular request by the user was completed successfully.

    201: This indicates that a particular request by the user was completed successfully with a new data set created.

    400: This indicates that the server cannot process the users request.

    404: This indicates that the server cannot retrieve the required data that has been submitted by the user since 
    it does not correspond to any data set in the database 

    500:This is mainly an internal sever error, meaning that the server cannot retrieve any data due to an error
    in the database.

4.When one forgets to include a WHERE clause in an UPDATE statement,
    When this happens, all the data being updated will be applied to all users in the database.
    For example if we were update ages of users, maybe user=1 from 21 years to 22 in the database and we did not specify the user id to 1, in this case,
    all the ages of the users in the database will be affected and changed to 22.

5. Causes of a 500 Internal Server Error in your API
    Loss of connection between our SQLdatabase sever and the MySQL server.
    An error in the syntax of the request the user is trying to request from the server.
    Database constraint violations where a user is trying to insert specific data that violates table constraints
    An unexpected error within the user's code that might cause the server to crash outside of the database, maybe a certain
    block of code.
